# Pytorch_MNIST
This is a MNIST digital recognition neural network model built by the Pytorch deep learning framework and a test visual interface written by PyQt5
##  Run / test environment: 
windows10, Pytorch, PyQT5 and Pycharm editor
### Project explanationï¼š
This project focuses on how to design a MNIST neural network to predict handwritten digits and use PyQT5 to design a UI interface to achieve visualization. Therefore, the pre-test effect of the cnn.pkl model in the folder is generally satisfactory. Network, you can download the file to your local file, you can retrain by modifying the neural network structure in the model.py file. If you want to test the effect directly, you can run test.py and ui.py files separately
